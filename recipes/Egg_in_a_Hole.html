        <h1>Egg in a Hole</h1>
          <p>Egg in the hole makes a delicious breakfast! A runny yolk egg cooked in the center of a piece of toast and eaten with a fork is a great way to enjoy an egg in a slightly different way. My kids feel fancy when eating these. </p>
          <H2>Ingredients</H2>
          <ul>
              <li>1,5 teaspoons bacon grease</li>
              <li>1 slice bread</li>
              <li>1 egg</li>
              <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Directions</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Step 1 </li>
            <p>Melt bacon grease in a nonstick pan over low heat.</p>
            <li>Step 2 </li>
            <p>Cut a 2-inch hole in the center of bread slice; place in the hot skillet and cook until lightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Flip bread and crack egg into the hole; season with salt and pepper. Continue to cook until egg is cooked and mostly firm; flip again and cook 1 minute more. Serve immediately.</p>
